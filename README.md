## How to Build

Note that in order to access the Unsplash API, you must:

- Create a developer account at: [https://unsplash.com/developers](https://unsplash.com/developers)
- Copy your app access key

Then add it to this file `Constants.kt`:

```
const val AUTH_HEADER_KEY = "Client-ID <Access Key>"
```
